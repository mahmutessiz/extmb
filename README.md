# README

## Note
Right now this project is not meant to be used since it is vulnerable to script injection. 
So do not use it as it is yet.

To use it you have to have ddcutil installed on your system. I only tested it on fedora 40.


## About

This is the official Wails Vue-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
